# Grandfather Fox [<img align="right" src=".github/fxaddon.png">](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/grandfather-fox/)
When you're browsing on Firefox, it's easy to lose track of time. The Grandfather Fox add-on turns your browser into a classic grandfather clock that will chime each hour. It promotes time awareness, while also giving your home office a bit of class.

The add-on currently features a variety of audio packs, including:
* Traditional grandfather clock
* Cuckoo clock
* Single beep
* Multiple progressive beeps
* Clock tower

You can also provide your own custom chimes.
